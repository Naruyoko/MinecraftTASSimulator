# Minecraft TAS Simulator
## For Forge for Minecraft 1.8.9

This is a mod providing an interactive simulation of Minecraft's player physics, to be used particularly in experimenting with TAS movements. It is able to replicate some movements such as movement keys and camera movements, which may be useful for looking at parkour and movement mechanics.

This mod is able to:
* :heavy_check_mark: Use Minecraft's physics engine itself to emulate player inputs
* :heavy_check_mark: Visualize the player's trajectory
* :heavy_check_mark: Simulate the basic keys for movement, i.e. WASD
* :heavy_check_mark: Simulate mouse movements
* :heavy_check_mark: Often provide a accurate-enough precision for deterministic parkouring

This mod is **not** able to:
* :x: Manipulate RNG
* :x: Be considered a valid TAS (by itself)
* :x: Simulate *all* keyboard and mouse inputs
* :x: Simulate sub-tick movements
* :x: Simulate GUI interactions
* :x: Play with savestates
* :x: Provide a "bare bones" simulation that is either machine-readable or built from ground-up

There are other mods that may provide these functionalities, such as [TASmod](https://github.com/ScribbleLP/TASmod).

For more information on TAS (tool-assisted speedruns), consult [TASVideos](http://tasvideos.org/) (for TASes in general) and ["An introduction to Minecraft TASing"](https://youtu.be/IIvW-HQ0HK4) by Scribble.

This mod is not yet ready for use other than myself, hence the pre-1.0.0 version. I don't know if I will ever get it out of it.
